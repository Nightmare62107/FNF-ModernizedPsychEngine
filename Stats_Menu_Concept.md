ENTERING THE MENU:

	- The Stats menu would be a menu that would be accessible inside the Awards menu.

	- Similar to Freeplay, there would be text at the very bottom of the screen. It would be similar to how it says "Press SPACE to listen to the song".

	- The text at the bottom of the screen would say "Press S to go to the Stats menu". That's how you would access the menu.

INSIDE THE MENU:

	- In this menu, the offsetSong music would be playing. The menu would consist of stats for things like how many times you died, how many arrows you've missed and hit, and stats for all the base game songs.
